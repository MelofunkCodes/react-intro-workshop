NOTE
1. The Pure Render Mixin (https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html), is the same as what Ziad did in class with the stateless constructors:

class ImageWithText extends React.Component {
    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps){
        if(nextProps.source === this.props.source){
          return false;
        }
        else{
          return true;
        }
    }
    render(){
        console.log('render was called');
        return (
          <div>
            <img src = {this.props.source}/>
            <p>{this.props.caption}</p>
           </div>
        );
      }
}
